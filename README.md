# First-C-program
This is my first C program. It's a translation of a linear search I did in python as a way to practice C...

1.) You'll be promted the length of the array you want. This array will generate completely random numbers
    so your number may not be in the list.
2.) Then, you will be prompted to input your favorite number or just any number. This is the number the linear 
    search algorithm will search for, keep in mind this array will generate completely random numbers
    so your number may take a few tries to be in the list. 

    Please critique as needed. This is my first piece of C code and would like to expand on it more.
